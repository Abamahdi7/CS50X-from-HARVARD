## Overview

This repository contains my complete work for **CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science**, Harvard University’s flagship introductory course. The course covers fundamental concepts of computer science and programming using multiple languages and paradigms, gradually progressing from low-level programming in C to higher-level abstractions with Python, SQL, web technologies, and Flask.

All problem sets, labs, and the final project were completed locally and/or in CS50 Codespaces and submitted via CS50’s official submission tools. This README documents **every week**, **every problem set**, and **the final project**, explaining goals, approaches, and design decisions.

## Final Project — BankVault

**Language:** C
**Type:** Command-line application

### Description

**BankVault** is a modular banking system implemented in C. It simulates core banking operations including account management, transaction handling, and persistent storage. The project is structured into multiple source files to ensure clarity, scalability, and maintainability.

### Features

* Account creation and management
* Secure transaction handling
* Persistent storage
* Modular architecture
* Command-line user interface

### Project Structure

```
